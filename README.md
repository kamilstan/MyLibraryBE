# MyLibrary App

This project is a back-end part of my application made in React.js, Express.js, TypeScript and MySQL.

You can check how it looks like here: http://mylibrary.networkmanager.pl/

## Introduction

This project is a simple library system, where you can check the book list and information about every single book. You can also add new user or add or delete a book when you are logged in. There is also possibility to register.

This is my final project after completing the MegaK course.

The project will be expanded with new functionalities in the future.

The project was written in Express.js, TypeScript and MySQL. I used Jest for testing and Jsonwebtoken for authorization.
